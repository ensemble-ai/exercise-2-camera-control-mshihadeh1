# Camera Controllers Code Review

## Functionality Assessment

### Stage 1 - Position Lock
- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

**Justification**: Simple but effective implementation. Correctly implements position locking and visual debug cross drawing. Clean inheritance from base controller.

### Stage 2 - Horizontal Auto-scroll
- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

**Justification**: Correctly implements auto-scrolling with player containment. Edge collision handling is well implemented. All required exports are present.

### Stage 3 - Position Lock with Lerp
- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

**Justification**: Good implementation of lerp-based following with proper speed calculations and leash distance enforcement. All required parameters are exposed.

### Stage 4 - Target Focus
- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

**Justification**: Successfully implements lead behavior and catchup mechanics. Good use of time tracking for movement states.

### Stage 5 - Four-way Speedup
- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

**Justification**: Complex push zone logic is well implemented with proper speed ratio handling and zone transitions.

## Code Style Review

### Strengths
1. Consistent use of typed variables and exports
2. Clear class inheritance structure
3. Well-organized drawing logic separation
4. Good use of Vector2/Vector3 for position handling

### Areas for Improvement
1. Inconsistent spacing around operators (e.g., `!target` vs `if !target:`)
2. Some magic numbers in position calculations (e.g., `y = 30`)
3. Debug drawing code is duplicated across controllers
4. Some missing documentation on complex calculations

Overall, this is a great submission!
